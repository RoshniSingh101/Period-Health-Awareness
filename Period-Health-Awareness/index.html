        <p>All women have periods, but no two periods are the same.</p>

        <h1>Menstrual Inequity</h1>
        <img src = assets/pic1.jpeg alt = "Calendar with yellow and pink color scheme with period products surrounding it">
        <p>According to a study done by Obstetrics & Gynecology in 2018, 64% of women reported that they had difficulty in affording menstrual products in the previous year. As of June 2023, 21 states in the US levy taxes from menstrual products as they are considered to be luxury items, while items that are considered to be necessities such as groceries, prescriptions, and over-the-counter drugs often do not have any taxes. </p>

        <h1>The Pink Tax</h1>
        <img src = assets/pic3.jpg alt = "Pink background with pink and purple razors and circular beige background for the razors">
        <p>The pink tax refers to an inflation on goods and services that are intended for women’s use. This can be attributed to menstrual products, makeup products, women's shampoos, razors, and lotions. Specifically, an example of this would include a pink razor marketed towards women being priced higher than a blue razor marketed towards men, with the color being the only difference between the two products. Although personal care items have the highest price differences, this tax is also applied to many childrens toys. A study done by the New York Department of Consumer Affairs found that bikes, scooters, and helmets intended for girls were priced higher compared to those intended for boys.</p>

        <h1>Gender Bias in Healthcare</h1>
        <img src = assets/pic4.jpeg alt = "Calendar with pink background and period products surrounding it">
        <p>Gender stereotypes can have an effect on how healthcare workers treat patients. A study done by the journal, Pain Research and Management, found that doctors often refer to men with chronic pain as “brave” or “stoic,” but refer to women with chronic pain as “emotional” or “hysterical.” Disparities such as this can lead to delayed diagnosis in women. This is particularly applicable to conditions such as endometriosis, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and pelvic inflammatory disease as the symptoms of these conditions can vary greatly. </p>
